# EXP-1A 
## Aim

- To print HELLO WORLD code in C++ language
- to write a calculator code in C++ language

## Software required-

You need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common options include:

- [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

## Theory
Printing "Hello, World!" in C++ involves several concepts fundamental to the language. To print "Hello, World!" in C++ programming, just place Hello, World! inside an inverted comma ("") after  cout<<.
#### Calculator code-
we have to use different operators like +,*,-,/ for performing aruthmetic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication and division. Also,we have to declare some variables usind int function.
## Code 1 SIZE OF DATATYPES 
```cpp
//RIDDHI LOKHANDE
//ENTC B2
//EXP 2 A
//23070123107
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of short int: " << sizeof(short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of long int: " << sizeof(long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned char: " << sizeof(unsigned char) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed char: " << sizeof(signed char) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned int: " << sizeof(unsigned int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed int: " << sizeof(signed int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned long int: " << sizeof(unsigned long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed long int: " << sizeof(signed long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned short int: " << sizeof(unsigned short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed short int: " << sizeof(signed short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned long long int: " << sizeof(unsigned long long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of bool: " << sizeof(bool) << "byte" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
This simple program demonstrates the basic structure and workflow of a C++ program, including the use of headers, the main function, standard output, and the return statement.
