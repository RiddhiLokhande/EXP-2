## Aim

- To print HELLO WORLD code in C++ language
- to write a calculator code in C++ language

## Software required-

You need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common options include:

- [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

## Theory
Printing "Hello, World!" in C++ involves several concepts fundamental to the language. To print "Hello, World!" in C++ programming, just place Hello, World! inside an inverted comma ("") after  cout<<.
#### Calculator code-
we have to use different operators like +,*,-,/ for performing aruthmetic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication and division. Also,we have to declare some variables usind int function.
## Code 1 HELLO WORLD
```cpp
//RIDDHI LOKHANDE
//23070123107
//ENTC B2
//EXP 1A
#include<iostream>
int main(){
   std::cout<<"HELLO WORLD";
    return 0;
